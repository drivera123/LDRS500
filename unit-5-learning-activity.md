#### **Summary Overview**

In fact, team leadership impacts the profitability and productivity of an organizationand success to a large extendis determined by the quality of the serviceprovided.Page and Wong \(2000\) use the image of a diamond to illustrate the reversal of roles that takes place between the leader and the followers in an organization when leadership is functioning optimally. Initially, vision and direction must be embodied and spread to the followers by the leader in a top-down approach.

**Page & Wong \(n.d.\)A conceptual framework for measuring servant-leadership**

Team leadership is a classic example of how an organization can influence team performance and effectiveness, and produce phenomenal results. “Team leadership represents a third characteristic of effective team performance” \(Zaccaro, et al., 2001, p. 452\). Effective leaders create, manage and empower teams that incorporate individual efforts of team members to produce high quality services, team performances and remarkable results. This is evident in private sector organizations and similarly, health care organizations dream of creating a “dynamic and responsive” healthcare workforce that can challenge the obstacles towards successful delivery of services \(Oliver, 2006, p. 38\).

## Assignment 6: Women in Leadership

Due end of week 8

One of your course readings for this unit is a compilation of data from women leaders in BC and India. The goal is to reach a larger sample size of women from around the globe. If you are a woman in leadership you can answer the three questions yourself. If you are not a woman in leadership, you will need to interview someone who is.

Please email Adrienne.castellon@twu.ca , provide your answers to the three research questions and a jpeg picture \(if the person gives permission to use for research purposes\). The answers to the questions are more important than the picture of course but will serve to make the envisioned publication more personal and authentic.

1. What is the greatest challenge you have faced or are facing as a woman in leadership?
2. What is something that you do that helps you to meet or deal with this challenge?
3. Do you have any other advice or encouragement for women in leadership?

#### **Summary Overview**

Ethical leadership is a necessary element in any organizations. According to Johnson \(2015\), ethical leadership enhances organizational trust levels, fostering perceptions that the organization is competent, open, concerned for employees, and reliable. Such trust leads to improved organizational performance and greater profitability. Moreover, ethical leadership grows an ethical organization climate that can increase job satisfaction and commitment to the organization \(p. xxi\).

Ethics is a personal trait, and it represents the behavior of a person. The behavior accumulates with a long time practice. Seidman believes that human has innate nature to think that we can figure out the difference between right and wrong \(Thompson 2007\). In other words, every individual has his or her ethical value to judge right and wrong.

Although it is hard to teach people ethics, however, it is possible to influence people’s behavior by effective leadership style. An appropriate leadership style could foster ethical climates in the organizations. Transformational leadership, servant leadership, and responsible leadership are useful approaches to improve the ethical behavior. According to Johnson \(2015\), transformational leaders engage in higher level moral reasoning, demonstrate greater integrity, are more successful at leading ethical organizational turnarounds, encourage the development of positive ethical climates, institutionalize ethical practices, and foster corporate social responsibility \(p. 230\). 

A great leader is not just telling the follower what to do, but building up their confidence and encouraging independent decision-making. As a leader should not only guide followers about how to work but also should demonstrate to followers how to become a leader. The leader can share power with followers, and give them the freedom to deal with difficult situations and to lead to self-actualization. That is the best way to improve employee engagement, and build a sustainable development for a brighter future.

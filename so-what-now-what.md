### Unit 8

##### Overview

In this unit you will consider the particular role and challenges faced by women in leadership. You will read about the complex path to leadership for women and consider·the research concerning gender and leadership styles, the obstacles encountered and how leaders can work towards leveling the playing field for men and women.

I credit Torild Skard, a psychologist, former Member of Parliament in Norway and Senior Researcher at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs for inspiring me to use the metaphor of a labyrinth. In _Women of power: Half a century of female presidents and prime ministers worldwide_, Skard \(2014\) makes the point that  a ‘glass ceiling’ is too simplistic; a labyrinth is more descriptive of the challenges that women in leadership face.

While the topic of women in leadership was virtually ignored until the 1970s, early research \(Day & Stogdill, 1972; Deaux, 1976; Dimarco &Witsitt, 1975; Kaley. 1971\) asserted that women were inferior to men and lacked skills and traits necessary for managerial success. Scholars started to ask ‘Can women lead?’ and opinions started to shift as people experienced women’s leadership in various organizations. A meta-analysis done two decades later by Eagly & Johnson \(1990\) found that Women were NOT found to lead in a more interpersonally oriented & less task-oriented manner than men in organizations. The only gender difference - women use a more participative or democratic style than men. The literature demonstrated that females were evaluated unfavorably when they used a directive or autocratic style \(stereotypically male\) and both female and male leaders were evaluated favorably when they used a democratic leadership style \(stereotypically feminine\).

Today of course there are many examples of successful women leaders and the current research questions have changed to “What are the leadership style and effectiveness differences between women and men?” and “Why are women starkly underrepresented in elite leadership roles?”

How can leaders level the playing field so that both women and men can have equal opportunities to make meaningful contributions in leadership? The culture in many North American organizations is changing. Gendered work assumptions are being challenged. There is increasing parity in domestic responsibilities and more women professionals and entrepreneurs. One practical way to reduce gender bias is to use advanced analytics to screen resumes to identify and remove gender bias resulting in a more diversified pool of talent and higher-quality candidates overall. Another way is to facilitate bias training with those involved with hiring to create more awareness. In the field of education, the power of literature and powerful female characters can be transformative.  The Catalyst publication \(2016\) linked to in the references and resources section provides many practical suggestions for how to design a more inclusive workplace.  Another excellent resource that is evidence based and highly readable is \_What Works: Gender Equality by Design \_by Iris Bohnet \(2016\), also referenced below.

The issue of gender equality in leadership needs to be addressed at the individual, interpersonal, organizational and societal levels. A more androgynous conception of leadership focusing on best practice is what is needed. How might leaders embrace the challenge? During the MA Lead program you have an opportunity to recognize your potential as a leader to transform the culture and spark social change, and be leaders who will work to achieve gender equality. Through education that builds competence and confidence, women are mentored towards a leadership approach that is inclusive and transformative. It’s an approach that helps women find their voice and their style while focusing on issues that are relevant and about which they are passionate to make a difference. Once women gain in their competence and confidence they have what is needed to navigate the labyrinth of being a woman in leadership. Whether you are a woman or not, this is a contemporary issue that all leaders need to be aware of and willing to address in their context.

##### Assessment

**Due end of week 8**: Choose any story from part seven or eight of the Light from Many Lamps anthology, read and savour its message and prose. \(Don't worry about critically analysing it.\)

1. identify the leadership lesson it tells;
2. explain its impact/relevance to your life and practice of leadership in your context;
3. write a 2-3 paragraph response in your blog containing 1 and 2. Syndicate your blog to the Learning Activities area of the course blog. Be sure to tag the response with the unit and learning activity number so it can be easily found.

**Due end of week 8:**

One of your course readings for this unit is a compilation of data from BC women leaders and 2 from India. The goal is to reach a larger sample size of women from around the globe. If you are a woman in leadership you can answer the three questions yourself. If you are not a woman in leadership, you will need to interview someone who is.

Please email Adrienne.castellon@twu.ca , provide your answers to the three research questions and a jpeg picture \(if the person gives permission to use for research purposes\). The answers to the questions are more important than the picture of course but will serve to make the envisioned publication more personal and authentic.

1. What is the greatest challenge you have faced or are facing as a woman in leadership?
2. What is something that you do that helps you to meet or deal with this challenge?
3. Do you have any other advice or encouragement for women in leadership?

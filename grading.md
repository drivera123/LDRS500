#### **Criteria and Evaluation**

**GRADING SYSTEM:MA Lead/MAEL Grading Rubric**

In an effort to ensure consistency in the MAL assignment of grades and to inform graduate students of assessments of the quality of work at the graduate level, the following interpretation of grades in assignments and courses offers a guideline.

| **Letter Grade** | **%** | **GradePointValue** | **Meaning in Graduate Work Note:**For assignments that meet criteria in several categories, instructors will assign an average grade. |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A+** | 95-100 | 4.3 | Exceptionally well-reasoned, compelling development of position. Outstanding incorporation of personal vision as well as of references and resources. Strikingly appropriate examples. Extraordinary insight, critical analytical and evaluative ability, and creativity. Superlative style and language usage. Makes an original contribution and is potentially publishable. |
| **A** | 90-94 | 4.0 | Well-argued and convincing development of position. Insightful incorporation of personal vision as well as of references and resources. Notably appropriate examples. Excellent insight, critical analytic and evaluative ability, and creativity. Impressive style and language use. |
| **A-** | 85-89 | 3.7 | Thorough and plausible development of position. Skillful incorporation of personal vision as well as of references and resources. Very good examples. Very good insight, analytic and evaluative ability, and creativity. Commendable and fluent style and language usage. |
| **B+** | 80-84 | 3.3 | Proficient development of position. Appropriate incorporation of personal vision as well as of references and resources. Relevant examples. Good quality insight, analytic and evaluative ability, and creativity. Clear and correct style and language usage. |
| **B** | 75-79 | 3.0 | Competent development of position, but possibly with some gaps and/or limitations. Satisfactory incorporation of personal vision as well as of references and resources. Satisfactory examples. Reasonable insight, analytic and evaluative ability. Little creativity. Generally satisfactory style and language usage, but possibly with some minor flaws. |
| **B-** | 70-74 | 2.7\* | Unimpressive development of position. Position not completely consistent with personal vision or references and resources not taken fully into account or examples are basic or not completely convincing or lacking acceptable insight and analytic and evaluative ability. Style and language usage with weaknesses \(e.g., clarity, coherence, grammar\). Overall quality shows noticeable deficiencies. |
| **C** | &lt;70 | 2.0 | Unacceptable work at graduate level. Shows lack of understanding and/or competence in several of the criteria described above. This grade is a failing grade at the graduate level, and students receiving a “C” course grade are required to re-take the course. |



## Ken's Suggestion

| Category | Exceptional \(10 – 9\) | Very Good \(8 – 7\) | Adequate \(6–5\) | Unsatisfactory \(&lt; 5\) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Argument | Argument is consistent and well laid out. Has no elements of inconsistency. Anticipates criticisms and provides counters arguments. | Argument is mostly  consistent and well laid out. Has one element of inconsistency. Anticipates criticisms and provides counters arguments. | Argument is mostly  consistent and well laid out. Has more than one element of inconsistency. Anticipates criticisms but provides no counter arguments. | Argument is mostly  inconsistent and not well laid out. Has more than one element of inconsistency. Does not anticipate criticisms. |
| References | Uses 3 or more references that are very relevant and illustrative of position. | Uses 2 references that are very relevant and illustrative of position. | Uses 1 reference that is very relevant and illustrative of position. | References provided are not very relevant and text does not illustrate a deposition. |
| Style and Grammar | Position is clearly articulated. No errors of style or grammar | Position is clearly articulated but contains up to two errors of style or grammar | Position is articulated with some inconsistency and contains up to four errors of style or grammar | Position is not clear and contains more than four errors of style or grammar |

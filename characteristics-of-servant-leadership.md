## **Characteristics of Servant Leadership  **


### **Listening**

Listening is active, an act of the will. Listening requires a commitment. The servant leader listens to identify the will of a person or a group. How well do you listen? Do you ask questions to get to other people ideas? Do you summarize and reflect back what you have hard?

### **Empathy**

Empathy is not the same as sympathy. Empathy identifies with the concerns of others. Servant leaders assume the good intentions in others for their value and worth. The servant leader knows and celebrates that we are all in this together. Do your co-workers understand that you feel what they put into their work? Do they feel they can admit to and safely learn from their mistakes? Do you as a leader admit to your own mistakes? Are you open to constructive criticism yourself? The practice of empathy is neither patronizing or condescending. It does not suggest the lowering of standards. It suggests a leader’s inner true strengthens and characteristics.

### **Healing**

Healing encourages us all to do something small to show that we care with our actions. We must always focus on making sure other peoples’ priority needs are being served. Another important aspect is helping people solve conflicts on their own.

### **Awareness**

Awareness can be defined as the ability to see things are they are. This involves the awareness of self and as well as awareness of situations. Robert Green-leaf once said,

> Awareness is not a giver of solace- it is just the opposite. It is a disturber, an awakener.

### **Persuasion**

We have been told that it is through persuasion that lasting changes occur. Seeking to convince rather than pulling rank is one of the clearest distinction between authoritarian leadership and servant leadership. In persuasion the leader takes the risk of going ahead to show the way. Along the way both the leader and the follower respect the integrity and allow the autonomy of the other. Think about how you have come to grow, has it been through manipulation or cohesion or were you genuinely persuaded?

### **Conceptualization**

From an organizational perspective conceptualization means thinking beyond day to day concerns. Many people in leadership are caught in the vortex of reacting instead of acting. A servant leader always tries to keep in focus the mission and goals of the organization. Through conceptualization the servant leader is able to see the patterns created by the details. As servant leaders we should never conceive any project as existing in isolation, but always a part of a larger vision. Learning to restate the corporate vision in their own terms, learning to dream their own dreams and learning to add their own insights and interpretations.

### **Foresight**

The ability to view the likely outcome of a given situation. It combines lessons learned in the past, realities of the present, and the consequences of the future. Foresight takes the past together with the present and projects the two of them forward. It acknowledges that future events do not come out of nowhere but are related to events in the past and present. \(Martin Luther King Jr. Speech\)

### **Stewardship**

In reflecting on stewardship, Abraham Lincoln said,

> No man is good enough to govern another man without their consent.

This country with its institutions belong to the people who inhabit it. How we use or take what is entrusted to us is what stewardship is all about. As servant leaders we must continue to realize that we are leaders entrusted to that which belongs to others. Whether it is the talent of our co-workers, the resources of our corporations or the ideals of the institutions. We must honor that trusted to us by being good stewards.

### **Commitment to the growth of people**

The servant leader will do everything possible to nurture the personal spiritual and professional growth of co-workers. In practice this means such things as providing resources and opportunities, continuing education and training, taking a personal interest in the ideas provided by the team. encouraging co-worker involvement in decision making and actively supporting laid off workers to find work. Vince Lombardi once said.

> Leadership is not so much leading as having the people lead accept it.

Such a statement can only be accomplished if a leader is committed to see growth from the team s/he is responsible for.

### **Building Community**

The servant leader realizes that creative and support community building must take place with institutions that we are all involved in. When community building happens the effects will extend far beyond.

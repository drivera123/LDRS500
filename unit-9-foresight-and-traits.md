### **Unit 9 Foresight and Traits**

### **Overview**

In Unit 9 we turn our attention to Foresight and the traits of a successful value-based transformational servant leader. The fact that values-based transformational servant leaders have important moves to make such as casting vision, setting mission and strategy, developing values, etc. remains at the heart of transformational servant leadership. The purpose of this unit is to critically think through important roles that leaders have in guiding and developing people and organizations. Enable learners to critically think through organizations, how they function, and how leaders function within them. This unit builds competency in strategic thinking, planning and organizing, adaptability and change, ethics and values, innovation, team leadership and collaboration.

#### **Read / Review**

PowerPoints on the **Four Components of Foresight**

In the article, Organizational Foresight and Stewardship, Malgeri \(2010\) defines foresight as the “ability to develop and maintain a forward-looking perspective and to anticipate emerging opportunities and problems by continually scanning the environment for trends and new developments. Foresight can be considered a behavioral inclination, referring to an individual’s tendency to devote a significant amount of time engaged in thought or activities concerning the future”.

#### **Post / Discuss**

The two YouTube videos show how all organizations must deal with environmental uncertainty. One recent change in our culture is an increased reliance on technology, especially for communication and transacting business. Consider various organizations, such as the United States Postal Service, Canada Post and retail businesses such as Walmart. How have they responded to these changes? What are some positive and negative consequences of these changes? Would you have done anything differently?

### **Assessment**

In the article, Southwestern Airlines \(A\) Stanford Business School Case HR1-A.Please provide an integrative reflection of how hiring, performance management, incentives, work design \(teams\), and leadership all support one another and provides an opportunity to warn against attempts to just change one element without an understanding of how they all work together.

The foresight of Southwest Airlines to use Human Resources for competitive advantage has been key to producing results and enabling the company to succeed especially in light of notable failures in their business. The question that lingers is whether airlines like United and Continental can imitate the Southwest approach. What is it specifically that SWA is doing \(concretely\) and what it takes to imitate these. Using the four learning **resources** in the unit, respond in 600 words to the questions below

Q: What does it take to make money in this business?

Q: Why is Southwest a success?

Q: What are SW’s sources of competitive advantages?

Q: What’s their strategy: Competencies?

Q: What does it take to execute this strategy?

Q: Are these sustainable? Imitatable?

Q: How does SW get its competitive advantage?

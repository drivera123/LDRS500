In the article entitled [_A corporate training view of ethics education: An interview with Dov L. Seidman, CEO of LRN_](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/10717919070130030701) \(Thompson, 2007\) graduate student Kenneth R. Thompson of DePaul University presents an in-depth discussion about ethics, organizational culture, education, and corporate governance solutions with Dov L. Seidman, Chief Executive Officer of LRN \(pp. 79-91\).The quote,

> “Frankly, the minute a company says, “we need to train our people on ethics,” they start going down the wrong road”

is a strong statement made by Seidman on his perspective towards ethics training in today’s business environment and aptly frames the context of this paper. Seidman is a change agent in the world of business ethics. His company, LRN has challenged the way organizations view ethics in business and moreover, how organizations inspire and coach ethics and ethical culture. Rather than promoting and supporting organizations to employ the isolated, “static” and scheduled method of ethics training that prevails in corporate strategy today, Seidman and his LRN team advocate for a more sustainable, meaningful, and realistic approach.

In reflecting on the article [A Corporate Training View of Ethics Education](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/10717919070130030701) complete a blog post of between 450 - 500 words by answering the questions below:

1. What was Mr. Seidman’s view of ethics training?

2. Why does he feel that the history of ethical thought isn’t helpful?

3. Do you believe, as Mr. Seidman states, that the global economy can make organizations amoral?

4. Explain how shifting from a program approach of ethics training to a cultural approach to ethical behaviour would work in your institution, school, organization, etc.

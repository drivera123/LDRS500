In this threshold course in the MA LEAD program you explored a number of topics that will be dealt with in more depth throughout the program in different courses. To set the tone we focused on Transformational Servant Leadership and the personal competencies we need to hone to improve leadership. We looked at leadership generally and more particularly, Women in Leadership, Ethical Leadership, Values-Based Leadership and Team Leadership.  We also explored certain skills that leadership need to develop such as Critical Thinking skills, how to develop people and organizations and the role of Foresight and Strategy.

As mentioned in the introductory unit, it bears repeating: while the complexity of leadership is undeniable, our conceptualization of it in the MA LEAD program aims to be holistic. Northouse (2016) defines leadership as ‘a process whereby an individual influences a group of individuals to achieve a common goal’ (p.6).  It is less important to know various definitions of leadership and more important to know the essence, principles and practices of good leadership. It is also important to know how leadership and management differ.

We hope you have enjoyed this first course and sincerely look forward to working with you throughout the program.

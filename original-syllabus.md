COURSE DESCRIPTION

This introductory course provides an understanding of the philosophical and theoretical basis for leadership, including the participant's stage of development. Major historical models for leadership are examined with special attention to servant leadership, and participants examine ways of improving their own leadership skills through practical interactive group exercises.

COURSE LEARNING OUTCOMES

1. The learner will begin the practice of Servant-Leadership personally, as well as within his or her organization.

2. The learner will comprehend the important role that Servant-leaders and managers play in directing, sustaining, and shaping organizations.

3. The learner will understand how the right kind of leadership can create meaningful and value laden employment opportunities and an engaged workforce through the application of Christian worldview perspectives on leadership.

4. The learner will be able to utilize and evaluate the importance of good communications and decision-making through practicing listening and problem solving skills in the challenges that you face in the business world.

5. The learner will be able to facilitate the development of tools for assessing and developing Transformational Servant-Leadership abilities and appropriate styles of leadership in any organization through synthesizing concepts and integrating them into the selection of appropriate leadership principles and practices that are lived out within religious and secular context

This course will focus on the following competencies primarily. The competencies will align with the Learning Integration Project \(LDRS 697/698\) manual so learners will know which courses will capture the leadership competency content.

| Dimension 1:Transformative Servant Leadership Values and Ethics | X |  |

Learning outcomes for this course are intentionally framed in terms consistent with Bloom's Taxonomy of thinking skills. These may be depicted as follows:

Bloom’s Revised Taxonomy, adapted by A. Churches \(2009\) from Anderson and Krathwohl, 2001.

This course will focus on thinking skills primarily in the higher domains. It is assumed that as learners encounter new material, the lower three categories of remembering, understanding and applying will be ongoing and provide the foundation to engage in the upper three domains. The course learning outcomes are aligned to the upper three domains of Bloom’s Taxonomy and operationalize the elements of foundational knowledge, application and integration in Fink’s Taxonomy of Significant Learning. Fink’s Taxonomy may be depicted as

follows:

Taxonomy of Significant Learning \(adapted from Fink, 2013, p. 36\)

GRADING SYSTEM:MA Lead/MAEL Grading Rubric

In an effort to ensure consistency in the MAL assignment of grades and to inform graduate students of assessments of the quality of work at the graduate level, the following interpretation of grades in assignments and courses offers a guideline.

| Letter Grade | % | Grade Point Value | Meaning in Graduate Work Note:For assignments that meet criteria in several categories, instructors will assign an average grade. |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A+ | 95-100 | 4.3 | Exceptionally well-reasoned, compelling development of position. Outstanding incorporation of personal vision as well as of references and resources. Strikingly appropriate examples. Extraordinary insight, critical analytical and evaluative ability, and creativity. Superlative style and language usage. Makes an original contribution and is potentially publishable. |
| A | 90-94 | 4.0 | Well-argued and convincing development of position. Insightful incorporation of personal vision as well as of references and resources. Notably appropriate examples. Excellent insight, critical analytic and evaluative ability, and creativity. Impressive style and language use. |
| A- | 85-89 | 3.7 | Thorough and plausible development of position. Skillful incorporation of personal vision as well as of references and resources. Very good examples. Very good insight, analytic and evaluative ability, and creativity. Commendable and fluent style and language usage. |

| B- | 70-74 | 2.7\* | Unimpressive development of position. Position not completely consistent with personal visionorreferences and resources not taken fully into accountorexamples are basic or not completely convincingorlacking acceptable insight and analytic and evaluative ability. Style and language |

|  |  |  | usage with weaknesses \(e.g., clarity, coherence, grammar\). Overall quality shows noticeable deficiencies. |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| C | &lt;70 | 2.0 | Unacceptable work at graduate level. Shows lack of understanding and/or competence in several of the criteria described above.This grade is a failing grade at the graduate level, and students receiving a “C” course grade are required to re-take the course. |

\*Note: a grade of “B-“carries a GPA of 2.7; learners require a composite GPA of 3.0 to graduate.

Other Designated Grades  
 INC=Incomplete. A grade may be incomplete if assignments remain outstanding in a course or if the instructor has not yet submitted a grade. If assignments remain outstanding at the end of a course, students must obtain and complete an incomplete grade form from Enrolment Services.  
W=Withdrew. This grade is assigned for students withdrawing during the first half of the course.  
WP /WF=Withdrew passing / Withdrew failing. These grades are assigned to students withdrawing during the second half of a course. Grades are not computed into the cumulative GPA. A student may withdraw from a course only because of severe extenuating circumstances and if approval is granted by the Program Director and the Dean of Graduate Studies.

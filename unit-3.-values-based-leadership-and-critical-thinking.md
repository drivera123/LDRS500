A huge amount of learning takes place in a social context. Have you ever thought of the possibility that online students who feel socially comfortable rather than isolated, exhibit higher order skills in analysis and synthesis more frequently than in face to face settings?  It is possible and this online group is proof of that! Have you noticed deep thinking during this course?  Encouragement of others? Active, polite and professional learning discussion? If so, carry on! If you'd like to see more, make a conscious effort yourself to exhibit those qualities and skills.

This unit is about values and critical thinking. They are linked intentionally because in order to commit authentically to values we need to have thought critically about what is important to us and what constitutes 'good'.  The internal goods of any discipline are the desirable outcomes characteristically aimed at through practice and make up our conceptual frame of reference.   We don't normally determine our values in a vacuum. Often we are guided and mentored by others or we are challenged by a disorienting dilemma.  The resulting dissonance leads to new perspectives, learning, and possibly new understanding of what is important - our values.

In this unit you will explore critical transformational learning, critical thinking, practical wisdom, traits and virtues related to leadership, practical ways to increase in wisdom, the compatibility of faith and critical thinking and the kind of critical thinking you will need in graduate level studies. The references cited below provide many avenues for more in-depth exploration of critical thinking and values-based leadership.

Please contact your instructor for a copy of the article, _Southwest Airlines \(A\) Stanford Business School Case HR1-A_. 

Please provide an integrative reflection of how hiring, performance management, incentives, work design \(teams\), and leadership all support one another and provide an opportunity to warn against attempts to just change one element without an understanding of how they all work together.

The foresight of Southwest Airlines to use Human Resources for competitive advantage has been key to producing results and enabling the company to succeed especially in light of notable failures in their business. The question that lingers is whether airlines like United and Continental can imitate the Southwest approach. What is it specifically that SWA is doing \(concretely\) and what it takes to imitate these. Using the four **learning resources** in the unit, respond in a post of between 500 - 550 words to the questions below

* What does it take to make money in this business?
* Why is Southwest a success?
* What are SWA’s sources of competitive advantages?
* What’s their strategy: Competencies?
* What does it take to execute this strategy?
* Are these sustainable? Imitatable?
* How does SWA get its competitive advantage?

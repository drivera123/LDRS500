**Unit 5: Team Leadership**

**Overview**

In Unit 5 Team Leadership, our focus looks at both the internal and external actions of an effective team and requirements of leadership as partnership.The purpose of this module is to critically think through these leadership frameworks along with team-based models and apply them to leadership context. This unit builds competency in innovation, adaptability and change, higher-ordered analysis, values and ethics, relationships and collaboration, team leadership, and people development. Please review the MA Leadership Monograph and Competencies for continued study on how these all fit together.

While team leadership focuses on providing and achieving tasks/projects that are aligned to the vision and mission of the organization, it also takes into consideration the importance of respect drivers practiced not only among the employee-employer level but also among the team members. Marciano \(2010\) presents essential RESPECT drivers in a workplace as recognition, empowerment, supportive feedback, expectations, partnering, consideration and trust.

In fact, team leadership impacts the profitability and productivity of an organizationand success to a large extendis determined by the quality of the serviceprovided.Page and Wong \(2000\) use the image of a diamond to illustrate the reversal of roles that takes place between the leader and the followers in an organization when leadership is functioning optimally. Initially, vision and direction must be embodied and spread to the followers by the leader in a top-down approach. However, once the followers have embraced the vision, leadership becomes fluid and begins to shift to a follower-driven model. The leader’s job is now to “invest in and serve others so that the mission can be accomplished.” \(p.8\)

**Page & Wong \(n.d.\)A conceptual framework for measuring servant-leadership**

Team leadership is a classic example of how an organization can influence team performance and effectiveness, and produce phenomenal results. “Team leadership represents a third characteristic of effective team performance” \(Zaccaro, et al., 2001, p. 452\). Effective leaders create, manage and empower teams that incorporate individual efforts of team members to produce high quality services, team performances and remarkable results. This is evident in private sector organizations and similarly, health care organizations dream of creating a “dynamic and responsive” healthcare workforce that can challenge the obstacles towards successful delivery of services \(Oliver, 2006, p. 38\).

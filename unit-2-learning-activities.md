#### **Summary Overview**

**The essence of leadership**

As we read peer reviewed literature we can take these learned theories and put them into practice. When we put theory into practice it will transform our values. This would be the goal of Transformational Leadership. Giroux \(2014\) suggests, there may be some days where the servant leader could be accused of laissez-faire leadership. When we know the rationale behind his/her decisions, however, we gain a better understanding of the why behind engaging laissez-faire. Author, Rakesh Wadhhwa \(n.d.\) blogs about the oxymoron in the term laissez-faire leadership and in fact, points out some of its benefits’ that could be seen to encompass some of the goals of transactional and servant leadership

* instills a higher sense of responsibility among team members
* exposes team members to tough business decisions, helping them to gain more experience and grow faster
* keeps team members aware of and continuously working towards the larger picture
* can bring out the best in members, encouraging greater innovation and out-of-the-box initiatives

**Values-Based Leadership and Transformational Servant Leadership?**

Values-based or ethical leadership is defined as "the demonstration of normatively appropriate conduct through personal actions and interpersonal relationships, and the promotion of such conduct to followers through two-way communication, reinforcement and decision-making" \(Brown, Trevino, & Harrison, 2005, in Leadership Monograph 2014, 2014, p 11\).

Transformational servant leadership combines the transformational and servant leadership models, and is described by Spears \(2004, in Leadership Monograph 2014, 2014, p 15-17\) as inclusive of 10 characteristics: listening, empathy, healing, awareness, persuasion, conceptualization, foresight, stewardship, commitment to the growth of people, and building community.

Jesus embodies each of these characteristics, in ways too numerous to write in one forum posting. \(Pooley, 2014\) asserts that, he is the son of God, yet was born in human form so he could best understand the temptations, pains and fears that we go through \(listening, empathy\). Healing was one of his primary callings, physically as well as emotionally and spiritually. He connected closely to God to develop self and community awareness, including conceptualization and foresight to develop goals and how to achieve those goals. He was the steward of the earth, with the salvation of humanity entrusted to him. Not once was a person converted due to coercion, but through genuine persuasion of the goodness of God. Jesus was committed to the growth of people through the development of his disciples, and their responsibility to spread God's worth in culturally sensitive ways. All of this developed the everlasting Christian faith community

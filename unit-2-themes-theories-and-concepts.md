### **Unit 2 – Themes, Theories, and Concepts**

##### **Overview**

In week two our focus will be on historical and current models of leadership theory and practice to build competency in adaptability and change. Furthermore, we examine concepts including the roles of essential leadership, framework of assessing leadership, the role of innate qualities and characteristics in how they are integrated appropriately in leadership practices.The essence of leadership is the process of influencing people, within a group with the attention toward a common goal. \(Northouse p 5,6\) **What is the difference between leadership theory and values?** Theories are research definitions and with measurable methodologies. Values are the key components that everyone agrees are essential to effective leadership

In their book Understanding Research: A Consumer’s Guide, Plano Clark and Creswell define theory as something that “explains and predicts the probable relationship among different concepts \(variables\)” \(Plano Clark & Creswell, 2015, p. 490\). We could regard that is part of the learning process. If we poke this object with a stick in the side it should move that way. Theories are made by researchers and proven and disproven through experiments and reported to us in research studies.Northouse states that leadership takes many forms from liaise-faire to transformational \(p190\). The liaise-faire approach can be defined as hands off, distance or leadership through avoidance. Transactional is management by exception \(active or passive\), contingent reward etc. The final form which we will aspire to is transformational leadership.

##### **Learning Objectives**

At the end of this unit the students will be able to

1. Identify the innate qualities and characteristics possessed by great leaders that sets them apart from followers.
2. Discuss why possessing the right skills are essential in enabling a leader to work effectively and accomplish the organizations goals.
3. Develop a framework for assessing leadership and understand how actions towards others occur on a task level and on a relationship level.
4. Understand that leadership is composed of both directive and a supportive dimension, recognizing what employees need and then adapting their own style to meet those needs.

#### **Unit Notes**

**The essence of leadership**

As we read peer reviewed literature we can take these learned theories and put them into practice. When we put theory into practice it will transform our values. This would be the goal of Transformational Leadership. Giroux \(2014\) suggests, there may be some days where the servant leader could be accused of laissez-faire leadership. When we know the rationale behind his/her decisions, however, we gain a better understanding of the why behind engaging laissez-faire. Author, Rakesh Wadhhwa \(n.d.\) blogs about the oxymoron in the term laissez-faire leadership and in fact, points out some of its benefits’ that could be seen to encompass some of the goals of transactional and servant leadership

* instills a higher sense of responsibility among team members
* exposes team members to tough business decisions, helping them to gain more experience and grow faster
* keeps team members aware of and continuously working towards the larger picture
* can bring out the best in members, encouraging greater innovation and out-of-the-box initiatives

**Values-Based Leadership and Transformational Servant Leadership?**

Values-based or ethical leadership is defined as "the demonstration of normatively appropriate conduct through personal actions and interpersonal relationships, and the promotion of such conduct to followers through two-way communication, reinforcement and decision-making" \(Brown, Trevino, & Harrison, 2005, in Leadership Monograph 2014, 2014, p 11\).

Transformational servant leadership combines the transformational and servant leadership models, and is described by Spears \(2004, in Leadership Monograph 2014, 2014, p 15-17\) as inclusive of 10 characteristics: listening, empathy, healing, awareness, persuasion, conceptualization, foresight, stewardship, commitment to the growth of people, and building community.

Jesus embodies each of these characteristics, in ways too numerous to write in one forum posting. \(Pooley, 2014\) asserts that, he is the son of God, yet was born in human form so he could best understand the temptations, pains and fears that we go through \(listening, empathy\). Healing was one of his primary callings, physically as well as emotionally and spiritually. He connected closely to God to develop self and community awareness, including conceptualization and foresight to develop goals and how to achieve those goals. He was the steward of the earth, with the salvation of humanity entrusted to him. Not once was a person converted due to coercion, but through genuine persuasion of the goodness of God. Jesus was committed to the growth of people through the development of his disciples, and their responsibility to spread God's worth in culturally sensitive ways. All of this developed the everlasting Christian faith community

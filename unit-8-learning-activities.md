##### **Learning Activity 1 **

1. Read the Unit 8 Notes from the link below and the 3 brief case studies in Northouse chapter 15. 
2. Post a response in your blog to one of the case studies using the questions in the Unit Notes as guiding prompts. 
3. Use the categories 'Unit 8' and 'LDRS500'.

##### **Learning Activity 2**

1. Take the Gender-Leader Implicit Association test in Northouse chapter 15 and read through the Catalyst \(2016\) report for practical inclusion ideas . 
2. In your blog write about how you can foster recognition and a sense of belonging for women in your workplace. 
3. Use the categories 'Unit 8' and 'LDRS500'.

##### **Learning Activity 3**

Part of the solution of leveling the playing field for women in leadership is being conscious of our bias – and being intentional about inclusion of women in high visibility assignments, sometimes called ‘stretch assignments’.  A “stretch assignment” is a project or task given to employees that is beyond their current knowledge or skills level in order to “stretch” employees developmentally. The stretch assignment challenges employees in order to learn and grow.

1. Complete the exercise to evaluate your trusted network for diversity. 
2. Watch the video [Unconscious Bias - Making the Unconscious Conscious](https://youtu.be/NW5s_-Nl3JE)
3. On a piece of paper, jot down the first names or initials of 10 people you know who are not family members.  \(1 min\)
4. Open the Trusted 10 work sheet \(from link below\) and review the diversity dimensions. Code your named people within the worksheet categories.  Once complete, review the worksheet and consider how diverse your group is. \(5 min\)
5. Now on a separate sheet of paper draw one large ring, another ring inside it and a ring inside of it, so you have a model three concentric rings. Place the names of your named people in the rings where:
   1. Outer Ring is Level 1 and the people are acquaintances, 
   2. Middle Ring is Level 2 and you are comfortable with these people in your home,
   3. Inside Ring is Level 3 and these people are your trusted 10. 

Again, review this drawing in context of diversity. It is most common that we replicate our world and we trust people who are like ourselves.  Is this true of yourself? If so, what can you do to increase diversity within your trusted network?

**Conclusion**

If as a leader we have a high visibility stretch assignment with access to senior leaders, who would you ask to complete it?  Likely your trusted 10 or level 2 maybe. And as shown above, this is likely not going to create diverse teams or give opportunities to women or others.

The lesson that this assignment tries to drive home is that we need to try to be more inclusive and go beyond our trusted 10, with appropriate oversight to give people a chance. Intentionally identifying people who work hard, who have a track record of effectively working across functions or units may be a relevant indicator of their suitability for these assignments even if they are not in your trusted ten!

It is common that motivated and eager-to-grow employees, of diverse backgrounds, will seek other opportunities if not given these opportunities with their current employer. If leaders can discern that the employee has the right motive, the right leadership assets and are willing to accept the costs of a demanding assignment, then the decision to give them a ‘stretch assignment’ may be a great decision for both the individual and the organization.

### Assignment 1: Follow the Leader

#### Assignment Instructions

_**Due: End Week 1**_

Identify an opinion leader whom you admire and follow that person on at least one social media platform two weeks prior to the class. \(Twitter, Facebook, blog, Instagram, etc.\). The person you choose to follow could be from your area of expertise, but that is not necessary.

Create a post on your own blog and answer the following questions about the leader you chose. 

* Identify the leader, the platforms on which you followed them, and an outline of their ideas and their impact. Please include a link to the leader's social media accounts.
* What are one or two significant ideas that your chosen leader espouses and what do you think about about these concepts in relation to your work as a leader? 
* What advice would you give the leader on how to better motivate followers or use the capabilities of the medium to influence people toward a common goal?
* How do the leader's values, ethics, or principles align with your own regarding leadership?

Before you publish your post, make sure you add it to the category 'LDRS500' and tag it with 'Follow the Leader'.

Once you have published your own post, respond to one or two of your colleagues' posts. If your colleague's blog does not allow comments, write your response as a single new post on your own blog and make sure to link to your colleagues' posts.

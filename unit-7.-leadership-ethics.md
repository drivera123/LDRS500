## Unit 7 Leadership Ethics

### Overview

In Unit \# 7 we turn our attention to an integrated approach in looking at issues that arise in leadership situations, while addressing the principles of ethical leadership, perspectives of ethical leadership from a value-based transformational servant leadership approach. This module builds competency in visioning, strategic thinking, innovation, and team leadership. Please review the MA Leadership Monograph and Competencies for continued study on how these all fit together.

Responsibility is a powerful construct that shapes our decisions, especially in leadership positions of management.  The higher the leadership position, the greater the amount of responsibility.  “Leaders have the power to illuminate the lives of followers or to cover them in darkness” \(Johnson, 2015, p. 2\) Positions of leadership come with great responsibilities.  These consist of organizational responsibilities and the responsibilities to our subordinates.  Huizenga \(2016\) asserts that how we carry out these responsibilities can be indicative of both good and bad leadership.  Good leadership brings light to subordinates.  Bad leadership can bring darkness in the form of harm to the organization and harm to the subordinates.  Mistaken assumptions and the lack of moral imagination can play a role in this kind of leadership, and Maxwell \(1993\) emphasizes, “Everything rises and falls on leadership” \(p. 162\).  Therefore, we find that the behaviors of servant leadership facilitate good leadership that fosters ethical decision making.  Servant leaders focus on and anticipate the needs of others.  “They can feel the pulse of the world which they inhabit and anticipate the world that is not yet born” \(Wong & Davey, 2007, p. 9\).  This world considers the well-being of those we lead.  “What we need most are servant leaders with exceptional abilities blended with hearts full of humility and love.  Such leaders can make this world a better place and restore people’s hope in the future” \(Wong & Davey, p. 11\).

Ethical leadership is a necessary element in any organizations. According to Johnson \(2015\), ethical leadership enhances organizational trust levels, fostering perceptions that the organization is competent, open, concerned for employees, and reliable. Such trust leads to improved organizational performance and greater profitability. Moreover, ethical leadership grows an ethical organization climate that can increase job satisfaction and commitment to the organization \(p. xxi\).

Ethics is a personal trait, and it represents the behavior of a person. The behavior accumulates with a long time practice. Seidman believes that human has innate nature to think that we can figure out the difference between right and wrong \(Thompson 2007\). In other words, every individual has his or her ethical value to judge right and wrong.

Although it is hard to teach people ethics, however, it is possible to influence people’s behavior by effective leadership style. An appropriate leadership style could foster ethical climates in the organizations. Transformational leadership, servant leadership, and responsible leadership are useful approaches to improve the ethical behavior. According to Johnson \(2015\), transformational leaders engage in higher level moral reasoning, demonstrate greater integrity, are more successful at leading ethical organizational turnarounds, encourage the development of positive ethical climates, institutionalize ethical practices, and foster corporate social responsibility \(p. 230\).

A great leader is not just telling the follower what to do, but building up their confidence and encouraging independent decision-making. As a leader should not only guide followers about how to work but also should demonstrate to followers how to become a leader. The leader can share power with followers, and give them the freedom to deal with difficult situations and to lead to self-actualization. That is the best way to improve employee engagement, and build a sustainable development for a brighter future.

## Outcomes

Understanding and answering the questions, what are the moral implications of leadership behavior? How are different leadership styles related to ethics of conduct? What are the factors that determine ethical leadership? The module offers insight in answer these questions by exploring the theories of ethics and leadership and attempting to relate the various leadership styles to extant ethical viewpoints.  
To examine the important role that leaders have in directing, guiding, and shaping organizations. Think critically and systematically about self-leadership and the leader’s impact on people and organizations to build competency in adaptability and change, ethics and values, and innovation.  
To synthesize the concepts and integrate them into selection of the appropriate  
leadership principles and practices as leadership is lived out in a context to build competency in organizational leadership and collaboration. Reflect upon and integrate leadership thinking related to values-based leadership and transformational servant leadership in your current leadership context to build competency in ethical leadership, people development, relationships and collaboration

2. Define and describe the principles of ethical leadership.  Which 2 of the 5 covered in Northouse Chapter 13 do you think are the most important? Why?   

### Assessment

In the article entitled A corporate training view of ethics education: An interview with Dov L. Seidman, CEO of LRN \(Thompson, 2007\) graduate student Kenneth R. Thompson of DePaul University presents an in-depth discussion about ethics, organizational culture, education, and corporate governance solutions with Dov L. Seidman, Chief Executive Officer of LRN \(pp. 79-91\). The quote,

> “Frankly, the minute a company says, “we need to train our people on ethics,” they start going down the wrong road”

is a strong statement made by Seidman on his perspective towards ethics training in today’s business environment and aptly frames the context of this paper. Seidman is a change agent in the world of business ethics \(Johnson, 2015, p. 251\). His company, LRN has challenged the way organizations view ethics in business and moreover, how organizations inspire and coach ethics and ethical culture \(Thompson, 2007, p. 89\) Rather than promoting and supporting organizations to employ the isolated, “static” and scheduled method of ethics training that prevails in corporate strategy today, Seidman and his LRN team advocate for a more sustainable, meaningful, and realistic approach.

In reflecting on the article “A Corporate Training View of Ethics Education” complete a three page reflection by answering the questions below:

1. What was Mr. Seidman’s view of ethics training?
2. Why does he feel that the history of ethical thought isn’t helpful?
3. Do you believe, as Mr. Seidman states, that the global economy can make organizations amoral?
4. Explain how shifting from a program approach of ethics training to a cultural approach to ethical behavior would work in your institution, school, organization, etc.

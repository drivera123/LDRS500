## Unit 6 People and Organizational Development

## Overview

This unit is about how a leader supports personal development of followers.  This assumes acknowledging that individuals are valuable and it is a good idea to invest time and resources in them. People development is one of the competencies transformational servant leaders nurture as they help people develop and perform as highly as possible. Based on the commitment to and the responsibility for the development of others, transformational servant leaders consistently promote the ongoing learning of members in their communities. Furthermore, in order to effectively support the developmental needs of members, transformational servant leaders consider appropriate strategies. People development should be approached through systematic, collaborative, and job-embedded processes based on people-centered principles. Such an approach will help promote a positive culture and create positive change in organizations. Supporting people development is the core strategy in producing right results at both personal and organizational levels.

This unit you will learn about the foundational principles of andragogy and how transformational servant leaders create learning experiences that develop people and organizations.

Andragogy is the art and science of helping adults learn.Creating a good learning experience for adults is what andragogy is all about. The resource of highest value in adult education is the learner’s experience. Malcolm Knowles, the foundational thinker of andragogy outlines six assumptions about andragogy:

1.As a person matures, his or her self-concept moves from that of a dependent personality toward one of a self-directing human being.

2.An adult accumulates a growing reservoir of experience, which is a rich resource for learning.

3.The readiness of an adult to learn is closely related to the developmental tasks of his or her social role.

4.There is a change in time perspective as people mature – from future application of knowledge to immediacy of application. Thus, an adult is more problem than subject centered in learning.

5.Adults are mostly driven by internal motivation, rather than external motivators.

6.Adults need to know the reason for learning something.

\(Merriam & Bierma, 2014, p. 47\)

With respect to transformative learning leaders of people development:

1.Foster transformative learning through critical reflection; use nonrational media such as storytelling, embodied knowing, intuitive and affective, emotional, and spiritual experiences. Other non-rational tools are music, poetry, art, photography, literature, dreams, drama, fiction

2.Engage in/encourage dialogue or discourse and social interaction

3.Create a space that is open and welcoming to this type of learning: safe, open supportive.

\(Cranton in Merriam S. & Grace A.P., 2011 pp. 331-333\)

For learning to be transformative and effective it needs to be job-embedded, ongoing and with built-in follow-up/ support. The most effective type of professional development for lasting change is not a one-time workshop. Traditional stand-and-deliver professional development is generally conducted with minimal transfer. Rather, effective professional development is an ongoing supportive relationship with follow up and mentorship \(Hui, Snider, Couture, 2016; Katz, 2013; Klinger, Volante & DeLuca, 2012\).

Sokal and Sharma \(2014\), through their review of literature around effective professional development, describe an ideal program as entailing between 30 and 100 hours of training hours spread over a span of six to 12 months, with in-house professional learning communities \(PLCs\) and coursework as part of the training.

To be a transformational servant leader is to develop people and recognize that one person will never possess all the information necessary to make the best decisions, nor have all the skills necessary to run an organization by him/herself. The wisdom is often ‘in the room’ – even among the participants. We must willingly seek input and collaboration with stakeholders. This strengthens both the quality of our decisions and the buy-in of those who will carry out those decisions. Acknowledging our personal limitations as leaders is probably the single most important step toward creating a safe, enjoyable, effective and democratic environment. Transformative learning is not an individual process but rather a personal process that is carried out in ‘integrally webbed totalities’ \(O’Sullivan, 2003 in Merriam S. & Grace A.P., p.328\). Our personal growth and transformation impacts others. As a result of this course or program, you may change the way you make decisions which in turn, affects all of the people in this web differently than they may have otherwise been impacted.

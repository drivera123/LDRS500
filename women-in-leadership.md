Women in Leadership

Due end of week 8

One of your course readings for this unit is a compilation of profiles from women leaders in BC and India.  If you are a woman in leadership you can answer the three questions yourself. If you are not a woman in leadership, you will need to interview someone who is.

Post the answers to the research questions on your blog including the name of the person interviewed \(or your own info\). Before you publish your post, make sure you add it to the category 'LDRS500' and tag it with 'Women in Leadership'.

1. What is the greatest challenge you have faced or are facing as a woman in leadership?
2. What is something that you do that helps you to meet or deal with this challenge?
3. Do you have any other advice or encouragement for women in leadership?

##### Women in Leadership

Due end of week 8

One of your course readings for this unit is a compilation of profiles of women leaders in BC and India. Your task for this assignment is to either interview a woman in a leadership position, or, if you are a woman in a leadership position yourself, respond to the following questions.

Before you interview a leader, you must first get permission from the person that you would like to interview to post the responses to the questions along with their name on a public blog.

1. What is the greatest challenge you have faced or are facing as a woman in leadership?
2. What is something that you do that helps you to meet or deal with this challenge?
3. Do you have any other advice or encouragement for women in leadership?

Once you have responses to the questions, please create a post on your blog and create a brief profile of your chosen leader. Make sure that you include the answers to the questions above and also \(with permission\) link to their social media profiles.

Before you publish your post, make sure you add it to the category 'LDRS500' and tag it with 'Women in Leadership'.

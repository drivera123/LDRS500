### Regular and substantive blog posts and responses

As you work through this course \(and the program\), much of your work will be completed on your own blog. You should have already set up a blog during the Orientation course, but if you haven't, you can access instructions [here](https://twonline.gitbooks.io/twu-online-orientation/content/activity-1.html).

This on-going assignment accounts for 20% of the final grade of this course. The following are the blogging posts and responses that you are asked to make listed by Unit and Learning Activity.

At the end of the course you will be required to cut and paste all your blog postings and responses into a document and sending it to your instructor for grading.

### Regular and substantive blog posts and responses

As you work through this course \(and the program\), much of your work will be completed on your own blog. You should have already set up a blog during the Orientation course, but if you haven't, you can access instructions through a link below.

This on-going assignment accounts for 30% of the final grade of this course. The following are the blogging posts and responses that you are asked to make listed by Unit and Learning Activity. When you post, remember to tag each entry with the Unit and Learning Activity number so it can be easily searched. 

All blog posts should be between 150 - 250 words.

* The original posting is of high quality, showing depth of knowledge on the topic. The post ends with an open-ended question to advance the discussion.
* Replies occur under two or more different threads, other than that belonging to the student. Replies are posted on more than one day during the posting period.
* Response posts to peers' original postings are respectful, show clear synthesis and evaluation of the content read, and provide depth, breath, or new insight to the topic. Reply posts stimulate thinking and advance the conversation.
* As appropriate, references are included from scholarly peer-reviewed non-course text or readings to support what is said in both original and reply posts.
* All posts are clearly written and contain no APA/spelling/grammatical errors

Marks accumulate at 3% per week â€“ 3 = outstanding on all criteria above; 2= meeting expectations; 1 = not meeting all expectations as outlined above but made an effort; 0 = did not make an effort to answer the question

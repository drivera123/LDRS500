## Assignment 1: Follow the Leader

#### Assignment Instructions

_**Due: End Week 1**_

Identify an opinion leader \(could be from your field or not\) whom you admire and follow that person on social media two weeks prior to the class. \(Twitter, Facebook, blog, etc.\).

Create a post on your own blog and answer the following questions about the leader you chose. Don't forget to link to the person's social media account.

* Identify the leader, the medium on which you followed them, and an outline of their ideas and their impact.\(2 points\)
* What are one or two significant ideas that your chosen leader espouses and what do you think about about these concepts in relation to your work as a leader? \(4 points\)
* What advice would you give the leader on how to better motivate followers or use the capabilities of the medium to influence people toward a common goal? \(2 points\)
* How do the leader's values, ethics, or principles align with your own regarding leadership? \(2 points\)

Before you publish your post, make sure you add it to the category 'LDRS500' and tag it with 'Follow the Leader'.

Once you have published your own post, respond to one or two of your colleagues' posts. If your colleague's blog does not allow comments, write your response as a single new post on your own blog and make sure to link to your colleagues' posts.

#### **Criteria and Evaluation**

**All evaluation in MA LEAD is to follow this rubric – based on the assignment it would be applied differently. I suggest below how it would apply to the assignment ‘Follow the Leader’**

**GRADING SYSTEM:MA Lead/MAEL Grading Rubric**

In an effort to ensure consistency in the MAL assignment of grades and to inform graduate students of assessments of the quality of work at the graduate level, the following interpretation of grades in assignments and courses offers a guideline.

| **Letter Grade** | **%** | **GradePointValue** | **Meaning in Graduate Work Note:**For assignments that meet criteria in several categories, instructors will assign an average grade. |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A+** | 95-100 | 4.3 | Exceptionally well-reasoned, compelling development of position. Outstanding incorporation of personal vision as well as of references and resources. Strikingly appropriate examples. Extraordinary insight, critical analytical and evaluative ability, and creativity. Superlative style and language usage. Makes an original contribution and is potentially publishable. |
| **A** | 90-94 | 4.0 | Well-argued and convincing development of position. Insightful incorporation of personal vision as well as of references and resources. Notably appropriate examples. Excellent insight, critical analytic and evaluative ability, and creativity. Impressive style and language use. |
| **A-** | 85-89 | 3.7 | Thorough and plausible development of position. Skillful incorporation of personal vision as well as of references and resources. Very good examples. Very good insight, analytic and evaluative ability, and creativity. Commendable and fluent style and language usage. |
| **B+** | 80-84 | 3.3 | Proficient development of position. Appropriate incorporation of personal vision as well as of references and resources. Relevant examples. Good quality insight, analytic and evaluative ability, and creativity. Clear and correct style and language usage. |
| **B** | 75-79 | 3.0 | Competent development of position, but possibly with some gaps and/or limitations. Satisfactory incorporation of personal vision as well as of references and resources. Satisfactory examples. Reasonable insight, analytic and evaluative ability. Little creativity. Generally satisfactory style and language usage, but possibly with some minor flaws. |
| **B-** | 70-74 | 2.7\* | Unimpressive development of position. Position not completely consistent with personal vision or references and resources not taken fully into account or examples are basic or not completely convincing or lacking acceptable insight and analytic and evaluative ability. Style and language usage with weaknesses \(e.g., clarity, coherence, grammar\). Overall quality shows noticeable deficiencies. |
| **C** | &lt;70 | 2.0 | Unacceptable work at graduate level. Shows lack of understanding and/or competence in several of the criteria described above. This grade is a failing grade at the graduate level, and students receiving a “C” course grade are required to re-take the course. |

**Substantive response to two other colleagues' Follow the Leader' assignments - part of online participation evaluation**

Grading rubric for replies to peers

Emerging - Responds minimally to peers and does not offer, or minimally offers, any insight in to their peer’s response.

Developing - Responds with some to good thoughtfulness to their peer’s response but does not, or minimally offers, peers thoughtful feedback.

Mastering - Responds thoughtfully with depth of critical thinking to their peer’s response and offers rich and helpful feedback.

## Ken's Suggestion

| Category | Exceptional \(10 – 9\) | Very Good \(8 – 7\) | Adequate \(6–5\) | Unsatisfactory \(&lt; 5\) |

Anticipates criticisms but provides no counter arguments. | Argument is mostly  inconsistent and not well laid out. Has more than one element of inconsistency. Does not anticipate criticisms. |
| References | Uses 3 or more references that are very relevant and illustrative of position. | Uses 2 references that are very relevant and illustrative of position. | Uses 1 reference that is very relevant and illustrative of position. | References provided are not very relevant and text does not illustrate a deposition. |
